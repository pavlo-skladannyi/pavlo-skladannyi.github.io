## Abstract

Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly integrating with sensor networks, significantly expanding the capabilities of real-time data collection, transmission, and processing. This integration is critically important for various sectors, including environmental monitoring, smart city infrastructure management, agriculture, and military operations. UAVs provide mobility and access to remote and hard-to-reach locations, enabling effective monitoring in areas where traditional networks are unavailable or ineffective. However, alongside these advantages, numerous technical challenges arise. These challenges include optimizing UAV flight routes to ensure maximum sensor network coverage, minimizing energy consumption, and addressing data security issues such as cyber threats. Another important aspect is flight duration, which depends on UAV battery capacity and energy-saving methods for sensor nodes, especially through the use of alternative energy sources, such as solar panels. The study presents a model of dynamic interaction between UAVs and a sensor network, examining the process of data collection, and transmission to a central server, and the impact of increasing the number of sensor nodes on the overall mission time. A stochastic model is proposed to account for environmental heterogeneities, such as data transmission delays caused by obstacles or changes in connection speed. An analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of these factors on data collection efficiency and to optimize flight routes, with a focus on dynamic programming algorithms and heuristic methods.
